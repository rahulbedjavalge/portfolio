# 🔒 Security Checklist for RahulAI Portfolio Deployment

## ✅ API Key Protection Status

### Environment Variables Security
- [x] **API Keys in Environment Variables**: Using `process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- [x] **gitignore Protection**: `.env*` files are properly excluded from Git
- [x] **Example File Provided**: `.env.local.example` shows required format
- [x] **No Hardcoded Keys**: No API keys in source code

### Production Security
- [x] **Vercel Environment Variables**: Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in Vercel dashboard
- [x] **HTTPS Only**: All API calls will use HTTPS in production
- [x] **Domain Configuration**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` set to `https://rahulai.com`

### API Security Features
- [x] **Rate Limiting**: Implemented in `/api/rate-limit/route.ts`
- [x] **Error Handling**: Proper error responses without exposing sensitive data
- [x] **API Key Validation**: Checks for API key presence before making requests
- [x] **Request Validation**: Validates incoming requests in API routes

### Security Headers
- [x] **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- [x] **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- [x] **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- [x] **Content Security**: Configured in next.config.ts

## 🚨 Security Reminders

### For Vercel Deployment:
1. **Never commit `.env.local`** - It's already in .gitignore
2. **Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard only**
3. **Monitor API key usage** on OpenRouter dashboard
4. **Use HTTPS URLs only** in production

### Environment Variables to Set in Vercel:
```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-actual-api-key-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://rahulai.com
```

### API Key Best Practices:
- ✅ API key is server-side only (not exposed to client)
- ✅ API key has appropriate usage limits
- ✅ Monitor API usage regularly
- ✅ Rotate API keys if compromised

## 🛡️ Additional Security Measures

### Function Security:
- API routes are serverless and stateless
- No persistent storage of sensitive data
- Timeout limits configured (30s for chat, 10s for rate-limit)

### Client Security:
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- All API communication through secure endpoints
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

### Domain Security:
- SSL/TLS certificate automatically provided by Vercel
- Security headers prevent common attacks
- CORS properly configured for domain

## ✅ Ready for Production!

Your portfolio is properly secured with:
- 🔐 Protected API keys
- 🚫 No sensitive data in Git
- 🛡️ Security headers configured
- ⚡ Rate limiting enabled
- 🔒 HTTPS enforcement

**Your API keys are safe and your portfolio is ready for deployment to rahulai.com!**
